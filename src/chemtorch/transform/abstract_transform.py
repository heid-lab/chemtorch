    Abstract base class for transforms in the chemtorch framework.
    This class serves as a base for creating transforms that operate single objects.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the subclass does not implement the :attr:`__call__` method.

    Example (correct usage):
        >>> class MyTransform(TransformBase[int]):
        ...     def __call__(self, obj: int) -> int:
        ...         return obj * 2

        >>> class BadTransform(TransformBase[int]):
        ...     pass
