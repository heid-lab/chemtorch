    Abstract base class for all stateless representation creators.

    Subclasses should implement `forward` with the arguments they require.
    The only requirement is that the return type is compatible with the dataset and transforms.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the subclass does not implement the :attr:`forward` method.

    Example (correct usage):
        >>> class MyRepresentation(RepresentationBase[int]):
        ...     def forward(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        ...         return a + b
        >>> r = MyRepresentation()
        >>> r(1, 2)
        3

    Example (incorrect usage, raises TypeError):
        >>> class BadRepresentation(RepresentationBase[int]):
        ...     pass
        >>> r = BadRepresentation()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
