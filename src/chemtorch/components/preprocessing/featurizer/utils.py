    """
    Applies a sequence of feature extractors to an item and concatenates their outputs into a single feature vector.

    Each element in `features` can be:
      - A callable: The callable is applied to `item`. The return value can be:
          * a numeric value (float or int): appended to the feature vector,
          * a bool: converted to int and appended,
          * a list of numerics/bools: extended into the feature vector.
      - A tuple (func, options): `func(item)` is interpreted as a categorical value and one-hot encoded
        using `options` (with an extra slot for unknowns), then extended into the feature vector.

    If `item` is None, returns a zero vector of the appropriate length.

    Args:
        item: The object to featurize (e.g., an Atom or Bond), or `None` to return a zero vector.
        features: A list of callables or (callable, options) tuples specifying how to extract each feature.

    Returns:
        List[float]: The concatenated feature vector, or a list of zeros if `item` is `None`.
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If `features` is not a list or if any feature is not callable or a (callable, options) tuple.
        TypeError: If the return type of a feature function is not supported (not float, int, bool, or list of these).
        ValueError: If any feature tuple does not have exactly two elements.
        RuntimeError: If an error occurs during feature extraction.
