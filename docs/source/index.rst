Welcome to ChemTorch!
=======================

ChemTorch is a deep learning framework for benchmarking and developing chemical reaction property prediction models. 
It builds on top of `Hydra <https://hydra.cc/>`_ and `PyTorch Lightning <https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/>`_, 
providing a flexible and modular framework for reaction modeling using machine learning.
